# ENVIRO

## Inspiration
There is so much harm being done to the environment. This hackathon gave me a great opportunity to do something to reverse it.

## What it does
Enviro has a login and register pages to provide users with a personalized experience. Users can track their sustainable actions and the hours they spent on it. Users get badges if they reach a certain number of days. Users can also talk to a chatbot to get sustainability ideas.

## How I built it
Gemini API, CSS, HTML, JavaScript

## Challenges I ran into
Making the chatbot was especially difficult. I tried using the documentation provided on the Gemini website, but it didn't work. Eventually, I took help from codingnepalweb and succeeded in making the website. Making the table was difficult too. I took help from the internet to solve the problem.

## What I learned
This project improved my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. I also learned to continue despite my project not always working as I expected.

## What's next for Enviro
Next, I plan to connect Enviro users with maps and other people. This will encourage people to continue doing sustainable actions while having fun as a group!
